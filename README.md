# MachineLearning-Classification_Medication
In this project, We Appyed the machine learning algorithm, Decision Trees. Using this classification algorithm to build a model from the historical data of patients, and their response to different medications. Then using the trained decision tree to predict the class of an unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.
